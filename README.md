# Implementation of Reinforce Algorithm

This repository contains code from the book "Foundations of Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Laura Graesser and Wah Loon Keng. Each folder has an algorithm and it's divided as in the book. It is being maintained by Ericka Bermudez for Deep Reinforcement Lab for HUFS. 

## Installation

You will need to have installed the software framework for reproducible reinforcement learning [SLM Lab](https://slm-lab.gitbook.io/slm-lab/) and its environment.
